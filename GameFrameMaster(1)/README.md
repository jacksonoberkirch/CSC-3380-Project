About Us
GameFrame came about through the collaboration of six individuals; Jackson Oberkirch, Howard Tsai, Feroz Mughal, Andrew Gremillion, Quentin Franck, and Matthew Landry. 
Prompted by our intelligent and extremely handsome instructor, the one and only Grant Williams, we began brainstorming ideas for our project. As we discussed, we discovered our mutual appreciation for games and the culture that goes along with them. 
It was this appreciation that became the seed that naturally grew into the software we dubbed GameFrame. 
Our goal for GameFrame was to create an easy to navigate program that could be used in a social gaming environment. 
We want friends to come together, and play their favorite games together! 
That’s our hope for GameFrame and we hope you’ll enjoy it as much as we do!
